Watch the Movie Longlegs (2024) – Everything about Osgood Perkins' "Longlegs" is designed to confuse you, unsettle you, and keep you thinking about it for hours or even days afterward.

The film is deliberately exaggerated, from its oppressive sound design to its extremely polite performances, leaning more towards a cinematic nightmare than anything resembling realism. Therefore, despite clear narrative influences, comparisons to Jonathan Demme’s “The Silence of the Lambs” feel somewhat odd. Sure, there's a female FBI agent and a serial killer, but Perkins is searching for something different.

It's essentially like watching the scene where Clarice hunts around the storage unit in the dark for 100 minutes. There's little room to breathe.

Perkins sometimes loses control of that fever-dream tone, as in the film's final exposition which is too direct and strangely tries to explain what happened in the last hour and changes. Nightmares don't need exposition dumps.

This may sound fussy, but it indicates the overall problem hampering “Longlegs.” Despite Neon's notable pre-release efforts to build buzz, and the likely soon-to-come very low Cinemascore, this odd film sometimes seems unwilling to fully commit to its creepy weirdness, pulling back or explaining its intentions when it should be seeking confusion as much as explanations. We remember nightmares we are still trying to understand more than anything else.

“Longlegs” opens with its most effective sequence, a flashback framed as if you’re watching someone's home movie through a living room projector. A car stops at a remote house, from which a young girl emerges.

Soon, Perkins plays with perspective, not only locking us in a tight frame but essentially giving us a child's point of view on the encounter that will follow, impacting everything that happens next. Cut to years later, around the excessive 90s – there’s a photo of Clinton on the wall of the FBI Director's office to set the time, yet much of the production design feels older than that era, again creating a kind of dream logic disconnection – as new agent Lee Harker (Maika Monroe) arrives for her first case.

Acting on a psychic hunch, she catches a serial killer, making the FBI suspect she might not be just an ordinary agent, sending her through a series of mental tests to prove she has unique abilities. Unfortunately, this thread is somewhat lost as the film progresses, mostly used to make Lee “special,” but Perkins' screenplay doesn’t have much impact on this aspect of her character.

This is one of the several places where “Longlegs” could have leaned more into its uniqueness. Sure, the film is weird for American multiplexes, but my argument is that it should have been even weirder.

One person who definitely gives it all to the weirdness is Nicolas Cage (and he has more strange acting tricks than most), who plays the main character, a Satan-worshipping serial killer seemingly inspired by Ted Bundy and Tiny Tim (the singer, not the hedgehog).

Harker is taken by Agent Carter (Blair Underwood) to investigate a series of family murders, horrific events where parents, usually fathers, kill their children and spouses before committing suicide.

No one would think these were just tragic, isolated events if there weren’t a mysterious figure out there sending cryptic notes like the Zodiac about the crimes, tied to specific dates on the calendar.

How does Longlegs orchestrate such brutality? And what do the dates mean? Alicia Witt plays Ruth, Lee’s devoutly religious mother, who always asks her daughter if she’s said her prayers. There’s a sense that Lee will need those prayers.

Everything in “Longlegs” feels crafted and chosen deliberately by the talented writer/director of “The Blackcoat’s Daughter” and “I Am the Pretty Thing That Lives in the House.” From the consistently low camera angles that increase tension by giving us a lower POV to the quick bursts of images and sounds that feel almost subliminal, even possibly to the character names.

Without spoiling anything, Lee has a very vampiric connection to Longlegs that made me wonder if Harker is a reference to Bram Stoker’s Dracula (pretty sure it is). And is it a coincidence that the only surviving last name is Camera (played by Kiernan Shipka, in an impressive one-scene performance)? WATCH NOW
